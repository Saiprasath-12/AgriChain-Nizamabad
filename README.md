# AgriChain-Nizamabad: Blockchain Traceability for the Agri-Supply Chain 🌾

**AgriChain-Nizamabad** is a robust proof-of-concept application designed to revolutionize the agricultural supply chain using modern web technologies and the principles of blockchain traceability. This platform focuses on creating a transparent, secure, and trustless system for tracking produce from the farmer's field to the consumer.

The goal is to empower local farmers in the Nizamabad region by ensuring fair pricing and providing consumers with verifiable information about the origin and journey of their food.

## 🌟 Features

* **Farm-to-Consumer Traceability:** Log and view every stage of the product lifecycle on a transparent ledger.
* **Decentralized Data:** Utilizes blockchain concepts for secure, immutable, and tamper-proof record-keeping.
* **Modern Interface:** Built with a fast, responsive, and intuitive UI using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.
* **Developer-Friendly:** Clear project structure and easy-to-use development scripts.
