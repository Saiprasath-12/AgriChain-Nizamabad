# 🌾 AgriChain Nizamabad

AgriChain Nizamabad is a web platform built to bring **trust, transparency, and traceability** to the agricultural supply chain.  
It’s designed to help farmers, traders, and buyers connect securely — powered by **Next.js, Tailwind CSS**, and a **tamper-proof blockchain layer**.

## 💡 What This Project Does

AgriChain simplifies the complex process of agricultural transactions.  
Farmers can register their details, list their crops, and record transactions securely.  
Buyers and traders can verify the source and authenticity of products — all in one place.

Everything is backed by a blockchain layer (conceptually and in development), so no data can be tampered with.  

In short: it’s like a **digital trust bridge for agriculture** 🌿
